# Report: Player Re-Identification â€“ Internship Assignment

## Task Overview:
Detect and track football players in a single video stream. Maintain the same ID for each player across frames.

## What I Did:
- Used YOLOv8 Nano (`yolov8n.pt`) for lightweight, fast detection.
- Ran detection on the first 10 frames of my video using Google Colab.
- Saved the annotated outputs as individual image files.

## Challenges:
- Could not run full tracking (ID persistence) due to short video and no tracker.
- Only detection was performed, but results were accurate.

## Improvements (if extended):
- Add a tracker like DeepSORT or ByteTrack.
- Process the entire video.
- Generate a final video output with ID overlays.
